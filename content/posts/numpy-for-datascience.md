NumPy is a package for scientific computing in Python it provides a multidimensional array object for fast operations on arrays such as mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting,selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations and much more.

<!--more-->

We have multidimensional lists in Python then Why NumPy?

#### Why NumPy over Python lists?

1. NumPy array are more compact than Python lists.

2. More efficient and fast in mathematical calculation for large data.

3. Vectorization

4. Broadcasting

#### Vectorization and Broadcasting

Vectorization is a technique of writing code without any explicit for-loops and indexing.
When we want to multiply two arrays element wise we generally do :
```python
>>> a = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[1,2,3]]
>>> b = [[3,2,1],[2,3,1],[1,2,3]]
>>> for i in range(3):
...  for j in range(3):
...   a[i][j] = a[i][j] * b[i][j]
... 
>>> a
[[3, 4, 3], [8, 15, 6], [1, 4, 9]]
```  
To avoid any of these for-loops and indexing NumPy provides vectorization. So, what if they were NumPy array and not multidimensional lists.
```python
>>> a = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[1,2,3]])
>>> b = np.array([[3,2,1],[2,3,1],[1,2,3]])
>>> a * b
array([[ 3,  4,  3],
       [ 8, 15,  6],
       [ 1,  4,  9]])

```
Easy?

Broadcasting refers to implicit element wise operations(In simple terms).
NumPy operations generally are performed element wise. To perform element wise operations array must be broadcasted or should be made of equal shapes. This conversion is done behind the scenes when you operate two array of unequal shapes. For eg :
```python
>>> a = np.array([1,2,3])
>>> b = np.array([[3,2,1],[3,2,1]])
>>> a * b
array([[3, 4, 3],
       [3, 4, 3]])
```
For the above operation firstly 'a' i.e `[1,2,3]` was converted to `[[1,2,3],[1,2,3]]` then element wise operation took place between 'a' & 'b' . So, this example shows both Vectorization and Broadcasting.

#### Getting started

NumPy does not come with Python itself for installation you may refer the [link](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html). If you have successfully installed numpy then continue reading below.<br/>
Whenever you start your python script first you have to import numpy package to your code and then start working with numpy. 
To import numpy to your python script type the following:
```python
import numpy as np
```
Here you import numpy module renamed as *np* .

This is enough for a brief description of numpy. Now, let's get NumPy in action.

#### Basics of NumPy

NumPy arrays are `ndarray` objects which stands for n-dimensional arrays of homogeneous data types.

##### Creation

How to make a NumPy array?

1. A NumPy array can be made with a list by calling `np.array(list,dtype)` and passing a list to it specifying the data types.
for further description on data types follow the [link](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/02.01-understanding-data-types.html).
```python
>>> a = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
>>> arr = np.array(a,dtype=np.int32)
>>> arr
array([[1, 2, 3],
       [4, 5, 6]], dtype=int32)
```

2. A NumPy array with zeros all over can be made by calling `np.zeros((rows,cols))` and specifying number of rows and columns.
```python
>>> np.zeros((3,2))
array([[ 0.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  0.]])
```

3. A NumPy array with a particular value all over can be made by calling `np.full((rows,cols),value,dtype)` and specifying number of rows,columns,value to be filled with and data type.
```python
>>> np.full((3,2),5,dtype=np.int64)
array([[5, 5],
       [5, 5],
       [5, 5]])
```  
4. Similarly for making NumPy arrays with '1' as a value call `np.ones((rows,cols),dtype)` specifying number of rows and columns with data type.
```python
>>> np.ones((3,2),dtype=np.int64)
array([[1, 1],
       [1, 1],
       [1, 1]])
```
5. NumPy also provides a way to produce indentity matrix. To make a identity matrix call `np.eye(dim)` and specify the dimension.
```python
>>> np.eye(3)
array([[ 1.,  0.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  1.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  1.]])
```
6. To make arrays with random numbers call `np.random.random((rows,cols))` and specify number of rows and columns. This will create a numpy array with random numbers between '0' and '1'.
```python
>>> np.random.random((2,3))
array([[ 0.54718331,  0.89454271,  0.88606565],
       [ 0.27136812,  0.23676152,  0.49494242]])
```

##### Slicing 

Slicing refers to selecting a particular part of an array by providing index ranges.

<div class="row">
	<div class ="card-image">
        <img class="responsive-img col s6" src="/images/numpyfordatascience/numpy-slicing.png">
    </div>
</div>

Specifying slices can extract a particular part of an array. We can specify a slice as `array[begin_row:end_row,begin_col:end_col]`.
```python
>>> arr
array([[ 1,  2,  3,  4],
       [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
       [ 8,  9, 10, 11],
       [12, 13, 14, 15]])
>>> arr[1:4,2:4]
array([[ 6,  7],
       [10, 11],
       [14, 15]])
```
Indexing starts at '0' and end_row and end_col in not included. So here `arr[1:4,2:4]`  means row(1) to row(3) and col(2) to col(3). 

When we leave a index blank like `arr[:3,1:]` this automatically fills as starting or ending of row or column respectively.

```python
>>> arr[:3,1:]
array([[ 2,  3,  4],
       [ 5,  6,  7],
       [ 9, 10, 11]])
``` 
A different way of slicing is `arr[start:stop:step]`. If you write `arr[1:10:2]` this means starting from index 1 to index 9 taking 2 as a step so to display indexes 1,3,5,7,9.
```python
>>> arr
array([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10])
>>> arr[1:10:2]
array([1, 3, 5, 7, 9])
```
We can also extract elements with specifying logical operations. `arr[arr>4]` this will give all elements greater than 4 in arr.
```python
>>> arr
array([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10])
>>> arr[arr>4]
array([ 5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10])
```

##### Statistical operations

Statistical Operations are very much optimised when we use NumPy array.
<br/>
```python
>>> array_1
array([[1, 2, 3],
       [4, 5, 6],
       [7, 8, 9]])
>>> array_2
array([[7, 8, 9],
       [4, 5, 6],
       [1, 2, 3]])
```
> _Note:- Axis value is for computing operation along rows when axis=1 and along columns when axis=0_     

<br/>
1. Computing mean with `np.mean(array,axis)` specifying name of array and axis. 
```python
>>> np.mean(array_1,axis=1)
array([ 2.,  5.,  8.])
```
<br/>
2. Computing median with `np.median(array,axis)` specifying name of array and axis.
```python
>>> np.median(array_1,axis=0)
array([ 4.,  5.,  6.])
```
<br/>
3. Computing sum with `np.sum(array)` for sum of entire array and `np.sum(array,axis)` for a particular axis.

```
<br/>
4. Sorting a array with `np.sort(array,axis)`.

       [4, 5, 6],
       [7, 8, 9]])
```
<br/>
5. Unique values across array with `np.unique(array)`.
```python
>>> np.unique(array_1)
array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
```
<br/>

##### Some Other Operations

After a quick basic, these are some more NumPy operations that are required for getting into DataScience.
```python
>>> array_1
array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
>>> array_2
array([4, 5, 6, 7, 8])
```
<br/>

1. To find intersection of two 1-dimensional arrays with `np.intersect1d(array_1,array_2)`.

```
> _Note:- number of elements in the array must be eqaul to rows * cols_
<br/>

9. To apply logical operation on an array and fill values according to _bool_ returned with `np.where(logic,True_fill,False_fill)` here logic specifies the logical operation wheread True_fill and False_fill are values to be filled when True or False is returned respectively.
```python
>>> array_1

       [4, 5, 6],
       [7, 8, 9]])
>>> np.where(array_1>4,1,0)

```
<br/>

10. To Generate random integers between a range with `np.random.randint(low,high,size)` here low and high are the ranges and size is the number of elements needed.
```python
>>> np.random.randint(0,50,15)

12. To return equispaced elements between a range `np.linspace(start,end,elements)` here _start_ and _end_ is the range and _elements_ is the number of elements required. 
```python
>>> np.linspace(10,30,10)
array([ 10.        ,  12.22222222,  14.44444444,  16.66666667,
        18.88888889,  21.11111111,  23.33333333,  25.55555556,
        27.77777778,  30.        ])
```

13. Concatenation of two arrays with `np.concatenate([array_1,array_2],axis)`.

>>> array_1 = np.random.rand(2,2)
>>> np.concatenate([array_1,array_2],axis=1)
array([[ 0.49812363,  0.06835159,  0.37823207,  0.97684743],
       [ 0.615256  ,  0.06289467,  0.10976521,  0.09625162]])
```

##### Shape
One of the important data member of `ndarray` is shape, We often need to know the shape of our numpy array.
For this we use `array_name.shape`.
<br/>
For 1D array, return a shape tuple with only 1 element (i.e. `(n,)`).<br/>
For 2D array, return a shape tuple with only 2 elements (i.e. `(n,m)`).<br/>
For 3D array, return a shape tuple with only 3 elements (i.e. `(n,m,k)`).<br/>
```python
>>> array_1
array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
>>> array_1.shape
(5,)
>>> array_2
array([[ 1.,  1.,  1.],
       [ 1.,  1.,  1.]])
>>> array_2.shape
(2, 3)
>>> array_3
array([[[ 0.,  0.,  0.],
        [ 0.,  0.,  0.]]])
>>> array_3.shape
(1, 2, 3)
```

Okay, that was the last one. Hope you understood everything but if not you can anytime search the numpy documentation [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/).

#### Conclusion
A warm up with numpy is done to get started with data science.
