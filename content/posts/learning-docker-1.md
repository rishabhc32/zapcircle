Docker is a platform for developers to develop, deploy, and run applications with containers. Deployment of applications using linux containers is called _containerization_. Containers allow developers to pack up an application with all its libraries and dependencies, allowing them to be portable among any system running Linux.
<!--more-->

Containers are not new, but momentum and ease around Docker's approach have pushed them to forefront.

### Containers vs VMs
A container runs natively on Linux and shares the kernel of the host machine with other containers. It runs a discrete process, taking no more memory than any other executable, making it lightweight.

By contrast, a virtual machine (VM) runs a full-blown “guest” operating system with virtual access to host resources through a hypervisor like virtualbox. In general, VMs provide an environment with more resources than most applications need.

### Images and Containers
In Docker, an __image__ is an executable package that includes everything needed to run an application--the code, a runtime, libraries, and config files.<br/>
A docker image is built from series of layers, each layer representing instruction in _images's_ __Dockerfile__. Each layer except the last one is read-only.

A __container__ is a runtime instance of image--what image becomes in memory when executed(that is, an image with a state).<br/>
We have an image, which is a set of layers as we describe. If we start this image, we have a running container of this image.

>  _Dockerfile is the recipe, image is the mould and container being the yummy cake._

<div class="row">
    <div class="col s12 m10 offset-m1">
      <div class="card">
         <div class="card-image">
            <img src="/images/docker1/container-layers.jpg">

         <div class="card-content">
           <p style="text-align:justify;">Each layer is only a set of differences from the layer before it. Creating a new container adds a new writable layer on top of the underlying layers. This layer is often called the “container layer”. All changes made to the running container, such as writing new files are written to this thin writable container layer.</p>

### Docker development environment
If we were to write a NodeJS app, our first priority isto to install Node runtime environment and additional packages as per our requirement. 

With Docker, we can just grab a portable Node runtime as an base image, no installation necessary. Then our build can include the base image alongside the app code. Ensuring that our app, its dependencies and runtime, all travel together.

These portable images are defined by a `Dockerfile`.

### Defining a `Dockerfile`
`Dockerfile` defines what goes on in the environment inside your container. In a `Dockerfile` we need to map the ports to outside world, specify the file we need to copy in the environment. However, after doing that, we can expect that the build of our app behaves exactly the same wherever it runs.

We will define a `Dockerfile` for a NodeJS express server.

1. Create an empty directory, `cd` into it and run `npm init`.

    ``` bash
    $ mkdir node-docker
    $ cd node-docker
    $ npm init

    This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
    It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

    See `npm help json` for definitive documentation on these fields
    and exactly what they do.

    Press ^C at any time to quit.
    package name: (docker)
    version: (1.0.0)
    description: Node docker app
    entry point: (index.js)
    ...
    ```
2. Install express.

    ``` bash
    $ npm install express

    npm notice created a lockfile as package-lock.json. You should commit this file.
    npm WARN docker@1.0.0 No repository field.

    +express@4.16.3    
    ```
3. Create file `index.js`, copy the following code into it, and save it.
{{< highlight javascript "linenos=table, title=hello">}}
// index.js
const express = require('express')

const HOST = '0.0.0.0'
const PORT = '8080'

const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send("Hello, World!")
 })

app.listen(PORT, HOST);
console.log(`Started Server on ${HOST}:${PORT}`)
{{< /highlight >}}

4. Create a file called `Dockerfile`, copy-and-paste following content into that file.

    ``` dockerfile  
    # Dockerfile

    # Use NodeJS runtime as parent image 
    FROM node:8

    # Set working directory to /app
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy required files from current directory to into container /app directory
    ADD package*.json index.js /app/

    # Install required packages
    RUN npm install

    # Make port 8080 available to world outside this container
    EXPOSE 8080

    # Start the server when container launches
    CMD ["node", "index.js"]
    ```
5. Now run the build command, to create a docker image.
    ``` bash
    $ docker build -t node-app ./
    $ docker image ls

    REPOSITORY       TAG                 IMAGE ID
    node-app         latest              326387cea398
    ```
    `-t` option is used to tag our image with a firendly name, _node-app_ in our case.
    <br/>
    `./` specifies path of our `Dockerfile`, which is current directory in our case.

6. Run the app, mapping your machine's port 4433 to container's pusblished port 8080 using `-p`.
    ``` bash
    $ docker run -p 4433:8080 node-app

    Started Server on 0.0.0.0:8080
    ```
    Go to url `http://localhost:4433` in a web browser to see your served webpage.
    
    If you are running Docker Toolbox on Windows, use Docker Machine's IP instead of localhost. In Docker Toolbox the container IP is behind Virtual Machine's NAT, so to get to a `localhost` port, we need to access it via Machine's IP.
    <br/>

    To get IP, run `docker-machine ip`. Now go to `http://{IP}:4433`. For example, `http://192.168.99.100:4433`
    <div class="row">
        <img class="responsive-img col s12" src="/images/docker1/running-node-docker.png">
    </div>

7. To run the app in background use `-d` option.
    ``` bash
    $ docker run -d -p 4433:8080 node-app
    ```
    To view logs of this container
    ``` bash
    $ docker container ls

    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
    f66a80cfbf45        yoyo                "node index.js"     About a minute ago   Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:4434->8080/tcp   stoic_bassi
    
    $ docker container logs f66a80cfbf45

    Started Server on 0.0.0.0:8080
    ```
    To stop the container 
    ``` bash
    $ docker container stop f66a80cfbf45
    ```

### Conclusion of part 1
Thats all for this part. In next part we will learn how to publish our image to Docker's public registry, Docker Hub and scale our application by running this container in a __service__.
