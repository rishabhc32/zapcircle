Today I started to learn Angularjs. I learn basics of angularjs like : what is angularjs, why i opt to learn it etc. Some useful commands like : installation of Angular CLI (`npm install -g @angular/cli`), create workspace for an angular app (`ng new app-name`), to start the server (`ng serve --open`). Apart from it i also made my first angular app which is nothing bust just a simple page showing some images and links. 

<div class="row">
        <img class="responsive-img col s10" src="/images/100dof/mittalprince/web.png">
 </div>
