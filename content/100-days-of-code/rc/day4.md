Today I continued learning intricacies of `React`. I studied about _Forms_ in React, Controlled Components, lifting shared state up to the closest common ancestor, composition of components and more importantly thinking and way of designing an app in React.

Next up I plan on learning code-splitting in React, using `create-react-app` CLI, configuring `Babel` and `webpack` and following an online tutorial to build up a React web app.
