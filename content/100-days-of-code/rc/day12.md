Ran Tensorflow Object Detection and MobileNet SSD. Tried implementing color detection in object(person) detected by MobileNet SSD. Started a tutorial to build a simple webapp using Material-UI in React. Target isto get familiar with Material-UI so as to make a _Random Quote Generator_ as listed on freeCodeCamp.
