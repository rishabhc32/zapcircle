There is no end to learning, but doing what is learned is essential to grasp it. So did i today, when i did course on deep learning there was a assignment on `Neural Style Transfer` but there then i followed the instructions provided. Today i decided to write Neural Style Transfer from Scratch.

#### Pledge
I, Rohit Sethi swear to complete `#100DaysOfCode` to the best of my ability and with true spirit.

<br>

#### Task Completed
On Day 11, I did the following :-

```
Used a pre-trained VGG16 to transfer a content image into a new Style with 10 epochs. 
```
<br>

#### Learnings
On Day 11, I learnt the following :-

1. A New edge to losses and how pre trained networks can be used to get a desired output.

2. Introduced myself to something new `keras.backend.gradient`.

3. Programming in Keras while still being in tensorflow.
