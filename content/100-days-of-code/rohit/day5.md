Today while sitting on my couch i questioned myself. Is `100DaysOfCode` really getting me better? and i got an answer after that immediately i started planning for my Day5. So, here it is:- 
<!--more-->
#### Pledge
I, Rohit Sethi swear to complete `#100DaysOfCode` to the best of my ability and with true spirit.

<br>

#### Task Completed
On Day 5, I did the following :-

```
Practiced keras and trained a convolution neural network for facial keypoint detection(15 keypoints).(kaggle)
```
<br>

#### Learnings
On Day 5, I learnt the following :-

1. I studied the mathematics behind categorical cross entropy, binary cross entropy, Focal loss for RetinaNet.

2. Struggling with the data to make it appropriate for the model.

3. Checkpointer in keras to observe loss and accuracy.

<br>
Today My model accuracy was very bad and I will surely try to improve it tomorrow.
