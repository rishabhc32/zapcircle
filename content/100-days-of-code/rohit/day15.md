Today i had my `interview` at `IIT-Delhi` for the position of `research associate`. I was asked a lot of mathematics and was grilled with practical deep learning questions which i crossed intelligently.
I was selected for the next round But unfortunately they canceled the internship drive as they wanted graduates to work for them and i being a undergraduate was underqualified. It was a great experience for me, It built me confidence for any further interviews. Now, I will apply for various other internships and work on the gaps left in my learning.
