And here comes the second rung. Today, continuing the journey with motivated mind and full energy i wrote my piece of code. 
<!--more-->
#### Pledge
I, Rohit Sethi swear to complete `#100DaysOfCode` to the best of my ability and with true spirit.

<br>

#### Task Completed
On Day 2, I did the following :-

```
Trained a BiLSTM on Toxic comment classification 
and achieved a validation accuracy of 98.20%
using pre trained word embeddings 
which countered for the overfitting of baseline model. 
```
<br>

#### Learnings
On Day 2, I learnt the following :-

1. In detail study of `word embeddings` such as word2vec, Glove, fasttext and using their pre-trained embeddings directly.

2. `dropout` and `recurrent_dropout` parameter in LSTM. 

3. Training BiLSTM with keras.

4. `Visualizing` accuracy, loss, val_accuracy, val_loss with plotting after each epoch.
