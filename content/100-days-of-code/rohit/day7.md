Yo! That's `NEWYEAR'EVE` guys. Yesterday, The thought of 1-D convolution was left in my mind. I was not sure how it can be used and proper working of them. So, i decided to do a project on time-sequence data with 1-D convolutions. Here it is:-

#### Pledge
I, Rohit Sethi swear to complete `#100DaysOfCode` to the best of my ability and with true spirit.

<br>

#### Task Completed
On Day 7, I did the following :-

```
Trained a 1-D CNN for classifying data from an accelerometer into various human activities with accuracy of 92% 
```
<br>

#### Learnings
On Day 7, I learnt the following :-

1. `confusion matrix` and it's importance.

2. Scoring the model as `precision` , `recall`, `f1 - score`.

3. callbacks such as `keras.EarlyStopping`.
