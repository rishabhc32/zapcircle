		<i>"Every word is not an abbreviation"</i>. Zap is a group of four members. We are studying in Northern India Engineering College and pursuing Btech degree. We all love to implement our theoretical knowledge into our real life. We also love to write blogs on what we learn. We have also represented India at Oulu HealthHack Hackathon at Finland. We are on 100Days of Code Challenge.

               I am Web Developer and an Open source contributor. I love building stuffs and implement my theoritical knowledge into practical. I am mentor at PublicLabs and also was GoogleCode-in mentor from same organisation. I have build projects like a telegram bot to tell demeographic feature, Krishi++ which is used for yield prediction with my other team members.

                I am Web Developer with expreience in DevOps. Learning new concepts in field of computer science is what drives my passion. I believe in applying theoritical knowledge to real life which helps in cherishing beauty of Engineering. I have made a 8-bit breadboard CPU. RAM, ALU, control unit, registers were all built on a breadboard and its ROM was programmed using Arduino. It was a great learning experience for all four of us. I also wrote a small Interpreter. I work with Node.js on backend and React.js on frontend and Docker for microservices. I have built projects like a bot sending Netlify build updates to telegram, a bot to color black and white images, a web app which can predict the shape drawn.

               I am a Machine Learning Engineer who loves Mathematics. My eagerness of learning and applying theoretical knowledge drives me. Other things that excites me is torturing data to reveal state of the art results . I have a never ending love for algorithms be it from sorting algorithms to algorithms used in neural networks. I mostly work with keras for deep learning but have a bit knowledge of tensorflow too. For data science i use scikit-learn, pandas, dask, plotly, bokeh, numpy,matplotlib, seaborn. I am competent and confident individual who knows how to deal with real-life probelms be it with computer science or life situations.
